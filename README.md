A custom planetary system simulation.

Planetbox is a simple, custom planetary system simulation.
It can simulate a whole planetary system and single planets and it's moons.
Planetbox allows you to add your own planets to the simulation, lets you name them and checks if the parameters are correct for the chosen type of a planet.

GUI Simulation is purely demonstrative, accurate equations and calculations are available in a 'Statistics.txt' file after pressing 'S' in a simulation window. 

## Set up the program ##

### Linux ### 

Install libraries used in the projects:
```
pip install thorpy
pip install pygame
pip install tkinter
pip install math

Pull branch *exec*. Go into *src/build/exec/exe.win-amd64-3.7/Planetbox.exe*. 

## Instructions ## 

* SPACE to pause/unpause simulation
* E to go back to the explorer 
* M to go to the menu
* A to go back to adding more planets 
* UP to zoom in
* DOWN to zoom out
* S to save information about your planetary system to a file containing all the calculations (simulation window)
